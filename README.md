## Abstract 
In September 2024, WalletHub published an article presenting the “Happiness score” of each US state (excluding any territories), classifying each state with a number between 0 to 100.  Each state's scores were produced by weighing averages from diverse datasets that constituted either of the three super variables of “Emotional & Physical Wellbeing”, “Work Environment”, or “Community & Environment”. Based on this methodology, states that were shown to have some of the highest scores included Hawaii, New Jersey, and Maryland (all scoring at least 60). In contrast, states that were found to have the lowest scores were Louisiana, Arkansas, and West Virginia (all below 40).  

Our main goal for this project was to conduct further analysis to investigate what other factors can correlate or even potentially influence a state’s happiness score outside of the original factors used to produce the scores. Interestingly, the original methodology heavily relied on micro-level factors (aspects related to individuals and households), while macro-level factors were relatively underrepresented. Our project is primarily interested in gathering additional macro-level data and using it for advanced analysis against happiness scores (also for the original super variables that were used to produce them). 

We present our findings as a Tableau Dashboard found here:
