# US State Happiness and Wellbeing Ranking Dashboard (Tableau)

## Abstract 
This tableau dashboard was inspired by an article on WalletHub that ranked the happiness of all 50 US States based on happiness scores, which were computed by weighting averages of multiple factors related to the dimensions of "Emotional & Physical Well-Being", "Work Environment", and "Community & Environment" (states were also provided an individual ranking to these dimensions). This dashboard aims to analyze other factors that the researchers didn't initially explore to evaluate their correlation with the state's happiness score, as well as their corresponding "Emotional & Physical Well-being" Ranking.


## Datasets Used:
- State Happiness Dataset (WalletHub)
- 2024 Index scores related to Housing, Transportation, Groceries, and Cost of Living from World Population Review
- 2020 Health care expenditure by state per capita from KFF
- 2022 Hospital Beds per 1000 from KFF
- States and Region (data that includes US state information including abbreviation, and region)
- 2022 Bars per capita (100,000) from vinepair.com (used ChatGPT to create the data from table screenshot of the website)
- 2024 State Mental Health Agency Expenditure per Capita from rehab.com (also used ChatGPT to create the data from table screen)
